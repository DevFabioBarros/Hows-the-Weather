# How's the Weather

**How's the Weather** is a sleek and interactive weather web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city. The app displays temperature, humidity, local time, and a brief description of the weather, along with dynamic backgrounds and favicon updates that reflect the current weather conditions. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it fetches data from a secure serverless API route using the OpenWeatherMap API.
